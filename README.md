# UnStd - C++ Standard Library Clone/Reimplementation

This is a C++ library that reimplements several classes, templates, and/or features of the C++ Standard Library,
along with a demo executable demonstrating their use. This is developed for learning/experimenting and not intended
for production use.

## Data Structures

- Array (Templated)
    - Stack allocated
    - Iterators
- Vector (Templated)
    - Iterators
    - Copy and Move Semantics
    - No heap allocation for underlying array until either data is added or if an initial capacity is provided to the constructor.
